    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If you want to take your standard pizza party to the next level, 
    try bringing things outdoors. Not only does the back yard better accommodate large groups, 
    but the pizza you get from an outdoor grill far surpasses 
    anything you'll get from your in-home oven.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Dough</li>
        <li>Tomato Sauce</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Toppings</li>
    </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place your pizza stone or steel (or a sheet of aluminum foil) directly on the grill grates.
             Close cover and preheat the grill on high heat.</li>
        <li> Once the grill is heated, use a pizza peel that is dusted with flour or cornmeal to slide your assembled pizza onto your stone or foil. Close the grill cover.</li>
        <li>Grill the pizza until the crust is browned, about 10 to 12 minutes. Use either a pair of tongs or a pizza peel to remove the pizza from the grill, and slice.</li>
    </ol>
